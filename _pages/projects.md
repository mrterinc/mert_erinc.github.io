**Clients’ Financial Misconduct and Their Reactions to Auditors’ PCAOB Inspection Results**

This study investigates the consequences of firms’ misconduct-related exposure to regulatory scrutiny driven by their auditors’ PCAOB inspection results. Using a text-based measure, I explore this exposure during the period of misconduct and the presence of exposure avoidance by clients. The findings point to some potential unintended consequences of increasing transparency in the audit industry.


**Estimating the Clients’ Demand for Audit Quality: Evidence from PCAOB Inspection Findings** *with* Angela K. Pettinicchio

The study attempts estimate the clients' demand for audit quality. We use a direct signal of audit quality observable by clients, the auditor's inspection performance, play a role in clients' auditor choices. In order to determine this impact as precisely as possible, we adopt the discrete choice demand estimation framework. We find that demand for auditors decreases with the amount of deficiency findings auditors receive.
