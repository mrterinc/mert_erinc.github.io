**Clients’ Financial Misconduct and Their Reactions to Auditors’ PCAOB Inspection Results**

This paper investigates the consequences of firms’ misconduct-related exposure to regulatory scrutiny due to their auditors’ PCAOB inspection results. Using a text-based measure, I explore this exposure during the period of misconduct and the presence of incremental exposure avoidance by clients. The findings suggest that, as a salient manifestation of this avoidance, auditor dismissals are more likely to occur for firms whose auditor’s deficiencies are similar to their alleged financial reporting misconduct. The overall inspection performance of the auditor, on the other hand, is found to have a negative impact on dismissals. Combined, these results suggest that misconduct firms are not concerned about their auditor’s inferior inspection performance per se, but rather about their inspection findings that particularly relate to their own misconduct. Finally, additional analysis provides some insight into the underlying agency mechanism and shows that having a powerful CFO is a determinant factor for the impact in question.
