**Clients’ Financial Misconduct and Their Reactions to Auditors’ PCAOB Inspection Results**

This paper investigates the consequences of firms’ misconduct-related exposure to regulatory scrutiny driven by their auditors’ PCAOB inspection results. Using a text-based measure, I explore this exposure during the period of misconduct and the presence of exposure avoidance by clients. The findings point to some potential unintended consequences of increasing transparency in the audit industry.
