**Clients’ Financial Misconduct and Their Reactions to Auditors’ PCAOB Inspection Results**

The paper aims to explore the consequences of firms’ misconduct-related exposure to regulatory scrutiny due to their auditors’ PCAOB inspection results, focusing on auditor dismissals. Using a text-based proxy measure, the similarity between client’s class action lawsuit filings and auditor’s inspection reports, I explore this exposure during the period of misconduct and the presence of incremental exposure avoidance by clients. The initial findings suggest that, as a salient manifestation of this avoidance, auditor dismissals are more likely for firms whose auditor’s deficiencies, as described in the PCAOB inspection reports, are similar to their alleged financial reporting misconduct, as described in the resulting class action complaint. The overall inspection performance of the auditor, on the other hand, has a negative impact on dismissals. Combined, these results suggest that misconduct firms are not concerned about their auditor’s inferior inspection performance per se, but rather about their inspection findings that particularly relate to their own misconduct.
