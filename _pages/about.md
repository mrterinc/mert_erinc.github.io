I am a PhD candidate at Norwegian School of Economics. I am affiliated to [FAIR - The Choice Lab](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/research/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My supervisor is [Erik Øiolf Sørensen](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/erik-oiolf-sorensen/){:target="\_blank"} and my research mainly focus on information preferences and effects of information in decisions.
